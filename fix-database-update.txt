This is due to a missmatch between the databases versions you said you are using in the settings.

Please follow this steps:

1) Go to /wp-include/ folder and open the version.php.
2) Find the value for  $wp_db_version, and write it down.
3) Now, open your database, check in the table called wp_options
4) Find the db_version value:

SELECT option_value FROM yourdatabase.wp_options WHERE option_name = 'db_version';

5) Those two values must be the same. Change it in the version.php file, not the database.
